## Description
Pig-Dice is a game where each player rolls a die until either a 1 or 6 is rolled. Each player accumulates points as long as he/she doesn't roll a 1 or 6. If the player should roll a 1 or 6, they forfeit their turn and no points are accumulated on that round. Either player has the option to pass as well.
The first person to score 100 or more points wins.
